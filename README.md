# Sonar Ranging
A systems project for Analog Electronics ELEC-3303 (Fall 2019). The project is to design and build an operational hand-held sonar range-finder which emits ultrasonic sound waves and receives the reflected wave and uses the time delay (and possibly other information) to calculate the distance from the transmitter to the object in front of it, and then displays the result to the user. The range-finder is also to have several different user inputs to switch between modes of operation.
